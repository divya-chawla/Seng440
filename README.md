# Seng440
Group Project for SENG 440: Embedded Systems

## The aim of this project is to do Audio Compression using Mu Law.

1. The project description can be found at ProjectDescription.pdf file
2. The main source code, and its assembly (.s) file is included in AudioComp Main Folder. 
3. The main source code was then optimised to reduce instruction count and execution time. This optmised code is stored in Optimised Main folder.
4. A hardware solution was proposed to further reduce instruction count. This proposed instruction set is stored in Hardware Folder.
